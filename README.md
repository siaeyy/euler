## Project Euler Solutions
There are solutions for **Project Euler** problems written in **Rust**.  
The only rule ~~I follow~~ in solutions is to use only the standard library.  

The main goal is to find solutions to the first 150 problems.  
*Currently: **11/150***  

You can find blogs about solutions on my [blog page](https://siaeyy.lol/blogs).  
Also can find direct links to blogs in below.
